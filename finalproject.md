Motivation : 
I got an email that I violated copyright law from CMU information security office. 
I was very lucky to prove that I did not download anything illegally because I was not at CMU when they thought I downloaded Star Wars episode. 
(I do not even prefer to watch those science fiction movies.) 
At that time, I was very embrarrassed and it was quite serious when they sent an warning document. 
They admitted that there was a mistake but I noticed that copyright issues were very important topic these days.
