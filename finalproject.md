# Project Summary
With or without our intention and acknowledge, we can illegally use pirate software & contents on the internet and infringe its copyright. 
For a reader, this presentation help them to realize what copyright infringement is and what we should be really careful about. 
I will also present What might happen if they violate copyright and what was the common misunderstanding behind famous copyright violation cases.

Readers can understand after the presentation
- What types of illegal infringement of copyright are
- How we can protect ourselves from penalty of copyright violation
- What the penalties for copyright infringement are

Motivation : 
I got an email that I violated copyright law from CMU information security office. 
I was very lucky to prove that I did not download anything illegally because I was not at CMU when they thought I downloaded Star Wars episode. 
(I do not even prefer to watch those science fiction movies.) 
At that time, I was very embrarrassed and it was quite serious when they sent an warning document. 
They admitted that there was a mistake but I noticed that copyright issues were very important topic these days.

# Method and medium

Flourish and Tableau will be used for the visualization and I will present charts and texts at Shorthand. Those technologies are what I have not used before this course so it might be challenging for me to finish the final presentation. However, I will do my best to apply knowledges from the lecture to utilize new tools and techniques. Flourish is more intuitive tool but I want to focus on Tableau more.
