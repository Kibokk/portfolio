# Part 3. Final Project (12/09/2022)


# Motivation & Self Assessment

My personal experience led me to adopt the copyright infringement topic for the final presentation. My experience is that I got an email from the Carnegie Mellon University Security office that I infringed copyright law for downloading a Star Trek episode on the CMU network through P2P sites. I showed my innocence by providing my unlogged status at the estimated moment for violation. With this experience, I noticed two things. First, CMU, which university I belong to, take care of Copyright law very seriously and takes action directly once they notice a copyright violation. Second, my knowledge about the infringement of copyright and my reaction as a suspect(not as serious as the word means) were not appropriate. I also realize that personal violation of copyright law can become quite serious. It was an opportunity to regret my ignorance, which had been considered that personal copyright violation is very difficult to be detected and not a big deal. Anyway, the case was closed as a happening and mis-collection of cases, so you do not have to worry about me.

However, looking back at the presentation I made, it was a bit insufficient to deliver my subject correctly to the audience. Being overwhelmed by the mission that should have been cleared in a minute, I rushed into the presentation and missed several parts that I wanted to emphasize. Thanks to my professor, Christopher Goranson and TA, Chanaradee, with whom I have already shared my experience, I could deliver the most important message that I had an experience with copyright infringement. I think that is the most important message and warning for the audience who have the same attitude toward copyrights as I had. Sometimes, we lost what we really want to share because we want to deliver what we prepared for the presentation and events. Reminding critique session and its feedback, my folks became curious when I mentioned my episode, and they started seriously thinking about this infringement of copyright. Sharing experiences will be the most effective way of persuasion or leading people to act for something. It does not matter how much we can be ordered to pay for a violation, but it can be a matter of what can happen in your life. 

# Adjustment after the presentation

There were several adjustments after the final presentation. First, I put my experience on the Shorthand. I checked all images and texts that I made to see if there was any plagiarism or copyright violation. Ironically, many audiences who gave me feedback anticipated that my infringement of copyright violation happened during the presentation. I tried to choose images from Shorthand provided as copyright-free images. And I used images by linking them directly from the source rather than downloading and editing them. Putting the reference and resource indication underneath the images, I try to clearly show that these contents have an original author and creator.

# Next Step

Still, it is very difficult to keep copyright law and understand it fully. The most important attitude toward this topic is always to have them in your mind and way on your work.
