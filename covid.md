# Step one: find a data visualization (with data you can use!)

Source : https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-media-and-misinformation/

# Step two: critique the data visualization
- Usefulness 
- Completeness
- Perceptibility
- Truthfulness
- Intuitiveness
- Aesthetics
- Engagement

# Step three: sketch out a solution

# Step four: Test the solution

First Feedback (in late 20s):
```sh
1. Preference : Option 1, 3 
2. Color (Blue, Red) is too strong to distinguish which information is more important. 
3. Following the keyword Misinformation, None part should get less attention.
4. Option 1, 2 seems that it is information about progress or increase and decrease something over time.
5. Names of sources will not show well in Option 1, 2.
6. It is difficult to know what the order on the chart was based on.
```

Second Feedback (in late 30s):
```sh
1. Preference : Option 1
2. I prefer to see the option 1 chart because I get familiar with this type of charts rather than other style.
3. It seemed so packed if you want to draw charts with the same number of sources. 
   (column bar will be so narrow and the name of source cannot show well.)
4. This chart looks that it has an order by None (blue) part.
5. Option 2, each line seems to be connected and have corelation with one another. <Not a good choice>
6. Legends are so difficult to understand so more explanation should be added.
```
