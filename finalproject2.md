# Shorthand
In this week, I created new story draft for my final presentation and tried to set up the table of contents, organization for the storyboard, and the location of the charts. I was able to learn how to use the storyboard and receive opinions and feedback on the presentation in front of prospective readers based on the Draft. However, since it is my first time to use Storyboard, it might take a more time than I expected to utilize the tool well.

Here is the preview of my Storyboard : https://preview.shorthand.com/nyjxumz621nmvDZq

# User research and interviews
a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story
 1. University students who try to find free movies and tv shows on the internet
 2. Parents who have teens or children using SNS like Tiktok and Instagram
 
b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
 1. In-person meeting
 2. online chat(whatsapp) with script
 
c. your interview script
 - Q. Can you explain about copyright and what can be happen if you infringe copyright law?
 - Q. Have you ever done anything that violates copyright?
 - Q. What you might have to know about copyright?
 - Q. Are you interested in famous copyright trial cases or punishment that I explained?
 - Q. What can you catch from charts that I provide?
 - Q. How I can improve my final presentation better?
 - Q. What is your suggestion for Shorthand draft?
 
d. the findings from your interview 
 - Interviewed 3 people (A: house wife, B: CMU students 1, C: CMU students 2)
 - Interview Result : All three knew about copyright at a very broad level, and for detailed copyright violation cases, it was difficult to distinguish whether the cases actually violated the law. Most were very curious about how many violations occurred per year and what the average fine was. Even if it was not through an easily explained case, they confessed that there was actually an experience of intentionally violating copyright, and they tended to think that such a violation would not be a big problem. One of the interviewees asked for an easy-to-understand explanation of copyright infringement, and hoped for a simple table or visual data. Most of them were familiar with copyright, but after hearing about copyright violations, they became more interested in the topic. Regarding the charts presented, there are parts that are not well understood without additional explanation, so it seems that some charts need to be reformed. However, the overall composition and storyline received generally positive reviews. All three interviewees gave their opinion that one minute cannot explain the entire contents, so it is necessary to summarize each section with 2-3 sentences and focus on making it easy for the audience to understand through charts. As for Shorthand, they were excited about Shorthand and the fact that there is such a tool that can easily create a web page. However, I received feedback that the composition of my final presentaion seems a bit difficult to see the chart, so I think I need to think about it.

e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified. 
- Have Shorthand complete key sentences and stories to get additional feedback
- Learn how to use Tableau and Flourish to change the type of a chart that received this week's feedback
- People are more interested in the actual case, so look for more relevant data
