# Shorthand(Storyboard)
In this week, I created new story draft for my final presentation and tried to set up the table of contents, organization for the storyboard, and the location of the charts. I was able to learn how to use the storyboard and receive opinions and feedback on the presentation in front of prospective readers based on the Draft. However, since it is my first time to use Storyboard, it might take a more time than I expected to utilize the tool well.

Here is the preview of my Storyboard : https://preview.shorthand.com/nyjxumz621nmvDZq

**b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview**
 1. In-person meeting : present charts and explain storylines. get a direct feedback (one person)
 2. Online chat(whatsapp & zoom) with script : indirect explain. offerd link and charts first without enough explanation
 3. Feedback during the lecture : critique exercise and get a lot advices for the final presentation

 - Interview Opinion (detail)
 1. All three knew about copyright at a very broad level, and 
 2. For detailed copyright violation cases, it was difficult to distinguish whether the cases actually violated the law. 
 3. Most were very curious about how many violations occurred per year and what the average fine was. 
 4. Even if it was not through an easily explained case, they confessed that there was actually an experience of intentionally violating copyright.
 5. And they tended to think that such a violation would not be a big problem. 
 6. One of the interviewees asked for an easy-to-understand explanation of copyright infringement, and hoped for a simple table or visual data. 
 7. Most of them were familiar with copyright, but after hearing about copyright violations, they became more interested in the topic. 
 8. Regarding the charts presented, there are parts that are not well understood without additional explanation, 
 9. So it seems that some charts need to be reformed.
 10. However, the overall composition and storyline received generally positive reviews. 
 11. All three interviewees gave their opinion that one minute cannot explain the entire contents, 
 12. so it is necessary to summarize each section with 2-3 sentences and focus on making it easy for the audience to understand through charts. 
 13. As for Shorthand, they were excited about Shorthand and the fact that there is such a tool that can easily create a web page. 
 14. However, I received feedback that the composition of my final presentaion seems a bit difficult to see the chart, so I think I need to think about it.

Class Feedback 
```sh
1. It is still difficult to find what audience should take into an action after the presentation.
2. Charts on Shorthand are not clear to see during the presentation.
3. You should not infringe the copyright with this presentation.
```


**e. changes you plan on implementing to your visualizations next week to address the issues identified.**
- Detailed storyline and decide each sections' order to comprehend audience effectively
- Learn how to use Tableau and Flourish to change the type of a chart that received this week's feedback
- People are more interested in the actual case, so look for more relevant data and cases
- Find other ways that chart shoule be shown well in Shorthand
- More data needed because some datas only have charts without backdatas but audience says that information is very important for the presentation.
